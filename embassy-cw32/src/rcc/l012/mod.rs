//! CW32L012 one-time factory-HSI and qualified direct-HSE/LSE clocks.
//!
//! Own-source qualification and retained-owner rules: docs/qualified-l012-hse.md.
//! HSI defaults to /12 (8 MHz); the distinct hardware CCS fallback is /24 (4 MHz).
//! Incoming oscillator frequencies, buses and Flash latency must already be legal.
//! Other bus-dependent peripherals, DMA and application interrupts must be quiescent.
//! No source frequency or board condition is measured. STABLE is a startup latch;
//! later source loss can halt execution or invalidate frozen clocks after fallback.
//! Poll limits count CPU iterations while execution continues, not elapsed time.
//! Failure publishes no clocks and requires reset before retrying. No PLL exists;
//! runtime retuning, automatic HEXEN, sleep/resume and recovery are not provided.
//! Common RCC captures inherited LSE ownership before this backend runs.
