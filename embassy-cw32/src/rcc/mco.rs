//! Owned HCLK/PCLK output on PA8, qualified only for CW32F030C8T7.
//!
//! Admission uses the initialized bus's exact, cycle-qualified envelope and an
//! explicit board declaration. The fixed 20 MHz, SPEED1, <=50 pF policy is
//! conditional: the datasheet calls its electrical values design/simulation
//! data, not measurements. Its fmax definition additionally requires 45..55%
//! duty and (tr + tf) <= 2T/3 under load. Neither this rate check nor integer
//! division proves those waveform conditions. Qualify the actual loaded
//! waveform and receiver, supply tolerance, routing, VOH/VOL/current, inherited
//! DRIVER setting, and power/thermal limits separately. Without that qualification
//! this is an observation output, not a fully qualified receiver clock.
//!
//! Opening GPIOA's shared work gate may resume other pins' sampling, filters,
//! edge/level detection and pending interrupts, including on a later error.
//! The gate stays enabled. Only PA8's lock bit is cleared; other low lock bits
//! are retained. PA8's former function is disconnected and its edge/level enables
//! are cleared, without clearing pending status or restoring its earlier mode.
//! The board and prior/downstream users must tolerate these functional effects.
//! These requirements are not hidden Rust memory-safety prerequisites.
//!
//! Register checks are snapshots, not measurements or fault recovery. Normal
//! interrupt-driven register updates are excluded by a critical section; DMA,
//! NMI, debugger/raw writes and physical clock faults are not. The original RCC
//! source and board contracts must continue to hold. There is no oscillator,
//! bus-divider, low-power restoration or clock-fault management here.
