//! One-shot, interrupt-driven DMA for CW32F030/CW32A030 and CW32L083.
//!
//! The implementation follows CW32x030 User Manual EN V1.0 §§8.4–8.8
//! (also checked against CN V2.5) and CW32L083 CN V2.0 §§8.4–8.8.
//! L083 also exposes safe staged UART/SPI requests; unsafe borrowed hardware
//! constructors remain x030-only.
//! It uses BLOCK transfers with REPEAT=1,
//! equal source/destination word widths and the channel's fixed priority.
//! There is no circular mode, programmable priority, packing or burst API.
//!
//! # Cancellation limitation
//!
//! These manuals do not document an acknowledgment that clearing CSR.EN has drained
//! an in-flight bus access. This driver therefore does **not** treat EN readback
//! as a cancellation guarantee. Dropping a transfer waits for its completion or
//! transfer-error indication before disabling the channel and releasing its
//! buffer borrow. A hardware-request transfer may block forever in Drop if its
//! peripheral stops supplying requests. There is deliberately no early-abort
//! method claiming otherwise. The staged UART/SPI wrappers instead own private
//! static staging and retain it across cancellation; see [`crate::usart`] and
//! [`crate::spi`].
//!
//! [`OwnedCopy`] owns static SRAM buffers and returns them only after clean
//! software-copy completion; errors permanently consume its resources. Its
//! safe entry is [`CopyChannel::copy`], using a capability admitted once during
//! normal HAL initialization. [`OwnedCopy::new`] remains the unsafe raw entry.
//! Direct PAC access is a low-level ownership escape; see [`crate::pac`].
//! The borrowed [`Transfer`] constructors
//! are also unsafe and additionally require retaining forgotten borrows. Awaiting
//! uses the real DMA interrupt; only explicit blocking waits and Drop poll.
