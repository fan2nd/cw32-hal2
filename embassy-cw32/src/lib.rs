///
/// On the five qualified CW32L083 RBT6/RCT6/RCS6/MCT6/VCT6 packages,

/// admission, existing ready-LSE reuse and closed work-gate preservation stay
/// unchanged. The full stopped-mismatch LSI consumer check occurs after PLL
/// stop; live detector contradictions are rejected before source mutation.
/// Conservative fallback admission gives no HSI/AHB/APB divisor credit:
/// raw factory HSI can reach 48.96 MHz, requiring VDD >= 1.8 V and retained
/// WAIT2 regardless of dividers or CLKCCS. This is a bounded software policy,

/// On CW32L010, starting a previously disabled LSE while RTC selects LSE

///
/// L010 LSE pad admission may temporarily run the whole GPIOB bank. Input

///
/// On CW32L010F8P6, CW32L010F8U6 and CW32L010Y8M6, selecting LSE SYSCLK

/// This entry classification is retained through a second admission at the
/// request edge; later STABLE cannot turn it into inherited monitored readiness.
/// Stable legal automatically requested LSI with LSIEN = 0 remains supported.
/// A needed HSI start/restart also rejects raw-HSIOSC MCO SOURCE = 3 and enabled

///
/// These checks do not establish universal LSI idleness. The handover must

/// StartupOnly SYSCLK can stop the CPU on source loss without a fault or error

/// CLKCCS is preserved. Documented HSI 4 MHz fallback is qualified up to 4.08 MHz
/// without bus-divider credit, but gives no register-state or progress promise.
/// All frozen LSE timings become invalid on loss/fallback. Dividers are installed

/// Errors may leave partial source/gate/Flash state and monotonic reservations;

///
/// On CW32L011K8T6 and CW32L011K8U6, LSE SYSCLK retains enabled,

/// Ordinary legal cold entry uses the existing guarded unchanged-LSI bridge

/// MonitoredExistingRoutes additionally requires stable, non-erased,

/// Held reset rejects inspection; each configuration gate restores separately,
/// preserving enable/restore failure distinctions. The same admission repeats
/// immediately before LSIEN, using the entry classification despite later
/// STABLE. Stable legal automatic LSI clients with LSIEN clear remain admitted.
/// RTC SOURCE = 3 requires already factory-ready HSIOSC; necessary HSI start or

///
/// The native PC14/PC15, whole-GPIOC, RTC_OUT/RTC_1Hz and raw PINLOCK rules

/// WAIT3 precedes guarded transitions. Final dividers are verified under factory

/// Existing HSIOSC/LSE calendar capabilities remain; no RTC/AWT migration occurs.
/// Errors publish no clocks, can leave partial state and require reset before

///
/// On CW32L012C8T6/C8U6, direct LSE SYSCLK uses the existing native LSE

/// (4 MHz, 3.92–4.08 MHz after factory trim). There is no PLL or public LSI
/// SYSCLK. LSE and configured HSI at the final dividers, plus the full fallback
/// without bus-divider credit, must independently fit the declared bus limits.
/// LSE bounds cover every cycle and the complete declared board envelope;
/// average ppm is insufficient. No frequency or board condition is measured.
///
/// MonitoredExistingRoutes requires entry-stable, non-erased, factory-matching
/// native nine-bit LSI TRIM at 0x001007C2, with unchanged TRIM/WAIT. The own
/// factory maximum is 36,080 Hz. The detector's extra edge is an engineering
/// margin, not a measured jitter or continuity guarantee. Later bridge startup
/// cannot manufacture entry monitoring. StartupOnly STABLE is a startup latch:
/// later LSE loss can halt the CPU without an error return. Existing fault,
/// IRQ, brake, CLKCCS and output-recovery policy remain in effect.
///
/// A needed entry-nonstable first LSI request rejects RTC/AWT SOURCE2 or

/// Factory-ready divider-only changes leave raw HSIOSC unchanged. RTC/AWT

///
/// The shared ADC1/ADC2 configuration-and-work gate may be opened to read EN.

///
/// The functional handover must permit or disconnect PB0 AF3 HSIOSC_OUT,

/// WAIT3 precedes guarded HSI handover. Final dividers and WAIT0/1/2/3 are

///
/// HSIOSC/LSE calendar capabilities remain; no RTC/AWT source, time, prescaler,

///
/// CW32L011/L012 have the same functional requirement when a new LSE feeds

/// BTIM1..3 code6, GTIM/ATIM TI code8 and LPTIM triggers1..4. L012 includes
/// PA01/PA03/PB14/PB15/PC13 and LPTIM triggers1..5. Its BTIM/ATIM mapping
/// conflicts remain unresolved; all documented alternatives must be inactive
/// or disconnected. Reserved RTC1HZ0 and a reset-looking selector are not

///
/// On L012, newly starting LSE also requires no independent direct LSE_OUT
