//! CW32L012 independent 12-bit ADC1/ADC2, ordered 1–8 slot software scans.
//!
//! Both typed converters borrow one [`Common`] guard owning BGR. No path resets
//! either converter or disables the common ADC gate. BGR/TS enables are monotonic:
//! constructor, error and drop preserve inherited comparator/OPA/ADC resources.
//! Shared analog resources intentionally remain powered after all owners drop.
//! This explicit guard and power retention differ from an ordinary standalone
//! Embassy ADC; reclaiming shared power requires a future whole-analog owner.
//!
//! VDDA is the only conversion reference and must equal VDD (1.7..=5.5 V).
//! The guaranteed minimum board supply selects the manual clock/rate bands and
//! datasheet acquisition minimum. ADCCLK is PCLK/1/2/4/8, at least 4 MHz and at
//! most 48 MHz. The manual's stricter 1 MSPS limit is also enforced. SampleTime
//! does not replace source-impedance/settling checks required by the board.
//! ADC limits and delays include the source-qualified HSI envelope. The board
//! must stay within rcc::HSI_BOUND_TEMPERATURE_C; extended-temperature HSI
//! accuracy beyond that interval is unqualified, even if other circuitry is rated.
//!
//! ADC1 also supports IRQ-driven finite software reads/scans. ADC2 remains blocking
//! because its shared DAC interrupt needs a separate lifetime contract.
//! No DMA, external-trigger, DAC-output, synchronized/slave,
//! calibration or engineering-unit API is exposed. Internal channels return raw
//! counts and require >=40 us acquisition. There is no READY or overrun flag.
//! Inherited sibling slave configuration is rejected before converter writes.
//! Raw register users must not change shared gate/reset/BGR or either owned ADC.
//! Raw users of an unowned sibling must not change its SLAVE bit concurrently:
//! the preflight check is a snapshot, not synchronization with arbitrary raw code.
//! Current scan contract: docs/adc-l012-scans.md. Historical electrical review:
//! docs/adc-l012-dual-ownership.md.
