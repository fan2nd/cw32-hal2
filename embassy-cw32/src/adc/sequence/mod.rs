//! L010/L011 12-bit, ordered 1–8 slot ADC sequences using each family's actual PAC.
//!
//! Blocking and interrupt-driven software conversions and the separately owned
//! L010/L011 `triggered` route are exposed. There is no READY,
//! overwrite flag, input follower, selectable internal reference, VDD/3, DMA,
//! or calibration API on this backend. Vdda means VDD
//! on L010 and VDDA on L011. Input must remain within 0..=reference and the
//! board's pin/supply ratings. L011 requires VDDA=VDD. Values are raw counts,
//! not calibrated units.
//!
//! The board declares its minimum supply; own-manual voltage bands and sample
//! rates, own-datasheet acquisition times, and L011's minimum 4 MHz ADC clock
//! are checked before register changes. These acquisition minima are only a
//! floor: high source impedance can require a longer SampleTime or an external
//! buffer, according to the selected family datasheet input-impedance limits. L011's manual 48 MHz maximum takes
//! precedence over the datasheet's conflicting 96 MHz maximum. Actual clocks
//! and waits include the source-qualified HSI envelope. The board must stay
//! inside rcc::HSI_BOUND_TEMPERATURE_C; extended-temperature HSI accuracy
//! beyond that interval is unqualified, even if other circuitry is rated.
//!
//! BGR is shared with VC1/VC2 through ADC_CR.BGREN. This driver never resets
//! ADC, clears BGREN, or disables a gate that was already enabled. After any
//! BGR use the gate and BGR remain enabled, including after drop. Conversion
//! and temperature circuitry are shut down. This deliberately trades power
//! for preserving a legitimate comparator owner; a future shared analog guard
//! may reclaim BGR only after every owner releases it. Raw ADC register access
//! must not concurrently change the conversion configuration or clear BGREN.
//!
//! Async IRQ/cancellation contract: docs/adc-low-async.md.
