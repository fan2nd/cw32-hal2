# SPI byte master with interrupts

Two ordinary loopback applications use the ten remaining SPI families' existing
full-duplex master configuration and exact package pin routes. `async_master`
uses interrupt-assisted PIO and `embedded_hal_async::spi::SpiBus<u8>`; it needs
no DMA channel or private staging buffer. `blocking_master` uses the existing
blocking bus and includes one 16-bit in-place loopback exchange. The existing
[F030/A030/L083 paired DMA examples](../spi-dma/README.md) remain separate.

These applications use the default internal clock configuration, mode 0,
MSB-first order, no MISO pull, no sample delay, and a requested 1 MHz SCK
ceiling. The existing clock-envelope solver may select a lower actual rate.
Clock bounds do not qualify board wiring, voltage, signal integrity or latency.
They are source/build applications, not on-hardware or electrical validation.

## Wiring

For each bus listed for your selected package, connect its MOSI pin directly to
its own MISO pin. Do not connect two push-pull outputs together. No SPI slave is
needed. SCK and the active-low software CS can be observed with an appropriately
rated logic analyzer; leave them unconnected otherwise. Disconnect real slave
devices first: the byte strings and 16-bit blocking exchange are loopback data,
not a command protocol suitable for an arbitrary device. Check the exact board
schematic and electrical limits before running any firmware.

Every selected bus is used. Multi-bus rows require separate MOSI–MISO jumpers.
All pins are separate within a row. The CS column is GPIO, not hardware NSS.

The checked sources are each family's own
[serial AF sidecar](../../cw32-data/af/),
[physical package map](../../cw32-data/pinouts/README.md),
[exact part memory catalog](../../cw32-data/parts.yaml) and generated package
metadata. F020's six routes are Table 5-3, printed p26 / PDF p27 of its own
current datasheet, as located in
[the F020 AF evidence](../../docs/f020-serial-af-evidence.json).
No route disables debug, reset or oscillator functions. L010 uses PA3 for MISO
and PA6 for MOSI; PA7/PA8 remain SWD, PA0/PA1 remain available to the HSE wiring,
and PB0/PB1 remain available to the LSE wiring. Do not substitute L011's route.
F002/F003 likewise retain their different PA2/PA5 SWD assignment.

L012 C8T6 and C8U6 each select their own exact feature and metadata name;
C8U6 does not enable C8T6 as an alias. L012's own CN datasheet V1.0 Table 5-3,
printed p36 / PDF index38, supplies the selected AFs. Table 5-2, printed
pp32–34 / PDF indices34–36, supplies the same selected positions on both
packages: SPI1 SCK/MOSI/MISO pads15/17/16 and CS pad18; SPI2 pads12/11/10 and
CS pad19; SPI3 pads30/32/31 and CS pad20. GPIO CS does not qualify hardware
NSS. The generated pin metadata does not itself contain physical pad numbers.

W031's internal RF host uses the same SPI1 controller. This external SPI
application requires RF not in use; safe external pad names do not create
independent RF ownership. Preserve the existing SPI/RF and whole-GPIOB
initialization/clock-inspection boundary described in
[the W031 ownership documentation](../../docs/qualified-w031-lsi-sysclk.md).
There is no RF command, reset, arbitration or continuity guarantee here.

## Application behavior

Each loop selects one bus, performs a seven-byte transfer against a three-byte
TX slice, a four-byte in-place transfer, an immutable-slice write, a read, the
empty byte operations and a final flush. The shorter TX is padded with zeroes;
write-only receives are discarded; reads generate clocks with zero dummy bytes.
The received arrays go through `black_box` for debugger inspection. No returned
value is asserted and no retry or peripheral recovery is added by the example.

The blocking application additionally exchanges two `u16` words using the
existing blocking method. The next byte operation restores its byte width.
There is no wider-word async API. CS stays low through each complete sequence
and becomes high only after all calls succeed.

L012 binds SPI1 separately and binds `SPI23` once to the complete
`SharedInterruptHandler<interrupt::typelevel::SPI23>`. Both SPI2 and SPI3
owners remain alive in the same main scope, and both are called on every pass.
The application uses the buses in sequence; it does not claim a runtime
concurrency or interrupt-latency measurement.

No operation is cancelled by these applications. If cancellation is later
added, keep the original device selected and await successful `flush` before
changing CS or releasing a device transaction. An error does not prove wire
idle: the applications park without unwinding, dropping the bus, changing CS
or retrying data. A dropped IRQ-PIO driver can destructively truncate a frame;
that is not a successful flush. `SpiBus` compatibility does not establish
cancellation-safe composition with a generic device adapter that releases CS
or its lock when a future is dropped. A hardware or clock fault may prevent
completion indefinitely; this example adds no timeout or throughput promise.

## Build

Select exactly one of the eleven exact features above. A family alias, a
package-less memory-size alias, or multiple selections cannot substitute for
one of these packages. `build.rs` checks the selected chip name, family, SPI IP,
all controller addresses and IRQ owners, selected signal/AF pins, distinct CS
pins, and the exact metadata Flash/RAM regions. It derives `memory.x` from those
regions and emits `-Tlink.x`, including when built from the repository root.
Flash begins at 0x00000000 and RAM at 0x20000000; no bootloader offset or enlarged
memory fallback is supplied. F002 retains its actual 16 KiB Flash / 2 KiB RAM.

The release profile deliberately uses size optimization (`z`), LTO and one
codegen unit, with debug and incremental output disabled. The Cargo lock is
derived from the existing SPI-DMA example lock: the new root package adds only
a direct edge to the already locked `embedded-hal` 1.0.0. No dependency version,
source or checksum changes, and the existing pinned Embassy revision is used.

From the repository root, for example:

```sh
cargo build --offline --locked --release --target thumbv6m-none-eabi \
  --manifest-path examples/spi-async/Cargo.toml --no-default-features \
  --features cw32f002f3p7 --bin async_master --message-format=json
cargo build --offline --locked --release --target thumbv6m-none-eabi \
  --manifest-path examples/spi-async/Cargo.toml --no-default-features \
  --features cw32l012c8t6 --bin blocking_master --message-format=json
```

Both bin names are explicit manifest targets. Builds only compile and link;
no flashing, execution or connected-device transaction is implied. Actual
acceptance commands, results and ELF section sizes belong to the separate
build receipts rather than this example's source.

The finite Stage94 main matrix includes `async_master` for exact C8T6 and
C8U6, retaining all three PIO buses and the complete SPI23 binding. Both
continue to use `try_new_async`; adding native DMA support does not change
that constructor's backend. C8U6's `blocking_master` route cfgs are widened
consistently with the new feature, preserving `try_new_blocking` and its
existing behavior. No C8U6 blocking ELF is selected in the Stage94 main or
clean matrices, so this feature-consistency change makes no new blocking
acceptance claim. The existing lockfile and release profile are unchanged.
The separate [native L012 DMA companion](../l012-spi-dma/README.md) supplies
the four staged DMA/PIO deployments; its build receipts do not establish
execution or acceptance of this crate's blocking binary.
