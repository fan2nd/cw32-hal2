# Owned HCLK and PCLK output on exact F030/A030 parts

These two unchanged ordinary firmware programs support exactly CW32F030C8T7,
CW32F030K8T7, CW32F030K8U7 and CW32A030C8T7. All use PA8 AF4. The C8T7 parts
use LQFP48 pin 29; F030K8T7 uses LQFP32 pin 18 and F030K8U7 uses QFN32 pin 18.
PC14/PC15 are absent on both K8 packages; no LSE routes are granted to them.
Generic family/density aliases and all other selections remain excluded.
`hclk` selects HCLK and `pclk` selects PCLK. Both select MCO /8 and hold the real
SYSCTRL and PA8 owners for the entire loop.
See the [complete ownership and electrical contract](../../docs/f030-owned-mco.md).

The example board declaration is 3.0–3.6 V, ambient −20–70°C and total PA8 load
at most 50 pF, including traces, receiver and measurement equipment. The same
operating declaration is used during HAL initialization and MCO construction.
These are example assertions that must be qualified for the actual board before
use; they are not measurements, a certified BOM or universal board settings.

Both examples explicitly select factory HSI /6, AHB /1 and APB /2. Their nominal
bus frequencies are 8 MHz HCLK and 4 MHz PCLK. With MCO /8 the nominal outputs
are 1 MHz and 500 kHz respectively; `clock_bounds()` retains the exact divided
source-qualified logical bounds, including HSI error. No frequency is measured.
The API supports /1, /2, /8, /64, /128, /256, /512 and /1024; these examples
deliberately use just the conservative /8 choice.

The HAL's conservative 20 MHz admission policy, within 2.4–5.5 V, −40–105°C
and nonzero total load at most 50 pF, does not establish loaded 45–55% duty,
rise/fall time, receiver suitability or pad-level pulse timing. F030 and A030's
own fmax tables are design/simulation data, explicitly unmeasured, and require
`tr + tf <= 2T/3` as well as the duty condition. A030 uses its own datasheet and
the shared x030 RM; the F030 SDK is supplementary. Qualify the actual waveform,
voltage/current, load, routing and package-specific power/thermal limits separately. Observation with suitable equipment
does not itself make the output a qualified receiver clock.

The input state must have MCO disabled and GPIOA out of reset. Construction
disconnects PA8, clears its lock and interrupt enables, and opens the whole
GPIOA gate. Other pins' sampling, filters and armed events may advance, including
before a constructor error; the gate remains enabled. Existing PA8/downstream
functions must tolerate disconnection, clock activity and stopping. Drop only
attempts a bounded shutdown; forgetting the owner may leave output active.
No oscillator or system/bus divider is changed by MCO construction or Drop.

Because the owner holds SYSCTRL, a live HAL `CalendarClock`, `LsiClock`,
`LseClock`, or an `Rtc` retaining such a clock cannot be held simultaneously.
The existing RTC preservation example is a separate executable, not a combined
MCO/RTC example. A forgotten reborrow can outlive its Rust owner in hardware;
safe token exclusion is not permanent hardware exclusion.

After ordinary data/PAC generation, the Stage77 main MCO link commands from the
repository root are:

```sh
cargo build --release --locked --manifest-path examples/mco/Cargo.toml \
  --target thumbv6m-none-eabi --no-default-features --features cw32f030k8t7 --bin hclk
cargo build --release --locked --manifest-path examples/mco/Cargo.toml \
  --target thumbv6m-none-eabi --no-default-features --features cw32f030k8u7 --bin pclk
cargo build --release --locked --manifest-path examples/mco/Cargo.toml \
  --target thumbv6m-none-eabi --no-default-features --features cw32a030c8t7 --bin hclk
cargo build --release --locked --manifest-path examples/mco/Cargo.toml \
  --target thumbv6m-none-eabi --no-default-features --features cw32f030c8t7 --bin pclk
```

Each exact feature can select either existing program; the finite acceptance
matrix above deliberately chooses four combinations. Its fifth ELF is the
separate A030C8T7 RTC `preserve_calendar` executable. Stage77 main verification
passed seven real libraries and five linked ELFs: all twelve commands exited zero
with no warnings, and independent main runtime and metadata reviews passed.
At main acceptance final-source clean had not run; completion requires a separate
two-library/two-ELF and finite-gates receipt. That fresh-extraction replay uses
F030K8U7 PCLK and A030C8T7 HCLK plus those two release libraries. Main execution
receipts are separate from these commands; no aggregate recipe or hardware run
supplied the results. Stage76's five-library/three-ELF main results and separate
one-library/one-HCLK-ELF clean scope remain historical evidence.

This crate has its own workspace, matching the other examples. Its build script
checks the exact generated 64 KiB Flash / 8 KiB SRAM map, writes `memory.x`, and
passes `-Tlink.x` explicitly. The lockfile retains the existing dependency versions
and source pins. Build/link success supplies no physical waveform validation.
