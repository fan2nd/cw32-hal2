# Safe init-admitted static SRAM copies

`dma::CopyChannel::new(p.DMA_CH1, Irqs)` consumes the physical singleton returned
by ordinary HAL initialization and returns an admitted capability. Its safe
`copy(source, destination)` method consumes that capability and two exclusive
`&'static mut [W]` slices. Both configuration rejection and successful completion
return the same owner type; errors and forgetting permanently retain resources.
Supported selections are F030/A030 and L083 with generated SRAM metadata,
plus exactly CW32F020C6U7/K6U7/F6U7 and the eleven native four-channel
selections listed below, plus CW32L012C8T6/C8U6. The F020 parts have 8 KiB SRAM at
`0x20000000..0x20002000`; generic `cw32f020` retains
`MissingMemoryMetadata` rejection. F020 uses native CH1/CH2 with independent
DMACH1/DMACH2 IRQs, not a five-channel controller view. Its own-source proof
and TX-only peripheral scope are in [F020 owned DMA](f020-dma-owned.md).
The word type is sealed to u8/u16/u32. Separate [L083 staged UART/SPI APIs](l083-peripheral-dma.md)
qualify only their RX/TX hardware requests; unsafe borrowed hardware constructors
remain x030-only.

The existing unsafe `OwnedCopy::new(Channel, ...)` and unsafe borrowed `Transfer`
constructors remain the explicit low-level integration path. No caller-supplied
safety condition has been added to the new safe copy method or to generic HAL
initialization. This software-copy layer introduces no cancellation acknowledgment,
timeout-release mechanism or claim of hardware validation. The separate
[staged UART TX API](uart-dma-tx.md) accepts ordinary borrowed input slices
through constructor-owned private storage; it does not change CopyChannel's
software-copy contract. RX and SPI have separate staged lifecycle contracts.

## Native four-channel cohort

The additional exact selections are CW32L031C8T6/C8U6/F8P6/F8U6/K8U6/K8V6,
CW32L052C8T6/R8S6/R8T6, CW32R031C8U6 and CW32W031R8U6. Each has
64 KiB flash and the exact SRAM interval `0x20000000..0x20002000`.
Generic `cw32l031`, `cw32l052`, `cw32r031` and `cw32w031` compile the
controller surface but retain `MissingMemoryMetadata` rejection; no capacity
is inferred from a family name. The controller has four physical channels:
CH1/DMACH1 IRQ9, CH2 and CH3/DMACH23 IRQ10, and CH4/DMACH4 IRQ11.
CH4 has no fifth-channel partner. A shared-vector handler records and clears
only its own running channel's terminal flags; channel lifetime never disables
or unpends a sibling's vector or resets/gates the shared controller.

Each family's own manual independently qualifies the existing copy engine and
its native eight-field R1W0 ICR seed. The typed all-one no-op preserves sibling
flags and reserved bits. Layout reuse does not supply another family's proof.
See [the four-family contract and evidence](four-channel-dma-owned.md).
Their only new peripheral-DMA consumer is [staged byte UART TX](uart-dma-tx.md#native-four-channel-cohort),
with all eleven package routes and the two L031 F8 UART1 exclusions retained.
No RX/combined UART, SPI, other request or borrowed hardware constructor is
added. Existing unsafe software-copy APIs remain available under their own
contracts. R031 whole-GPIOA effects and W031 internal RF boundaries retain
the existing clean-runtime/functional handover obligations; this is no RF
handover or coexistence qualification.

## Supported platform boundary

Normal firmware enters Rust after a hardware reset, or after trustworthy
low-level runtime integration has established a clean handover: no outstanding
bus access, no armed or clock-gated DMA operation, and no pending request that
can resume when a clock is enabled. This is the platform basis for HAL startup,
not a per-copy responsibility passed to ordinary safe code. Arbitrary inherited
active DMA can already corrupt the application's stack/static memory before
`init` runs, so this API does not claim to recover that unsupported situation.

Register snapshots cannot authenticate boot history. EN=0, STATUS=0, empty flags,
zero descriptors, a closed clock gate or a sticky reset-source flag do not prove
that arbitrary preceding bus accesses drained. No such proof is claimed here.
A gated unknown transfer can resume when its clock opens. The admitted path
therefore combines the supported platform entry with one-time HAL initialization
and conservative rejection observations; it never manufactures quiescence by
clearing EN, resetting the controller or waiting an arbitrary number of cycles.

The PAC retains pinned chiptool's existing raw-access model: register methods
use safe Rust syntax but are technically unsafe hardware integration and may
violate memory safety/ownership. Its README and the HAL's `pac` reexport now say
so explicitly. Safe HAL operations are resource-safe within that boundary;
this change does not claim whole-PAC-plus-HAL soundness against arbitrary
safe-syntax raw register writes. Unsafe `steal`, raw writes, an external debugger
and low-level runtime takeover must preserve existing ownership, including after
error/forget. A feature flag or wrapper would not make arbitrary PAC writes safe.

## Startup admission and shared RCC lifetime

After clocks and any selected time driver initialize successfully, and before
peripheral tokens are returned, `dma::init` runs once under a critical section:

1. Missing generated SRAM metadata records `MissingMemoryMetadata`, without
   opening the DMA clock or reading channel registers.
2. An already-enabled shared DMA gate or asserted shared reset records
   `InheritedState`. It does not release reset, clear flags, enable a vector,
   reprogram a channel or toggle the gate.
3. Otherwise central generated `DMA::RCC_INFO` enables the clock using the same
   bounded attempt budget as clock initialization. Failure records `ClockNotReady`
   and does not inspect channel registers. A failed enable can have changed the
   gate; no retry or claim of preserved hardware state is made.
4. After enable acknowledgment, ISR and every physical channel's CSR, CNT,
   SRCADDR, DSTADDR and TRIG must equal their documented zero reset values.
   Any nonzero observation rejects the entire controller with `InheritedState`.
   The full-register check includes reserved fields and is deliberately
   conservative. It is a read, not a guessed register-clear/no-op command.
5. Only the default observation records `Available`. Nondefault rejection occurs
   after gate enable and leaves the gate on. This diagnostic is valid within
   supported reset/clean-runtime entry, not harmless active-bootloader recovery.

Admission is never rerun at channel acquisition. All outcomes are retained for
that boot. Existing `Raw` admission is never overwritten, including an unsafe
pre-init token fabrication. No DMA reset is issued, no flags are acknowledged,
and no IRQ is enabled during admission. `CopyChannel::new` changes `Available`
to `Owned` once and enables only its bound real vector; failure returns the
unused singleton and changes no hardware state.

RCC reset polarity and enable identities come from the existing central
source-qualified metadata. For all admitted profiles, AHBEN.DMA=1 enables the
configuration/working clock and AHBRST.DMA=0 asserts reset. Shared DMA reset and
clock-disable policy are already disabled in generated RCC controls. No safe
copy, completion, Drop, error, or last-owner action resets/gates the controller.
The public RCC surface exposes queries, not arbitrary reset/disable methods.
The newly admitted normal init path retains the DMA gate even if no copy is used;
this is a small deliberate power/lifecycle change from previous late enable.

## Capability and state transitions

The pinned Embassy singleton macro has private token fields, a crate-private
one-time `take`, and unsafe `steal`. `CopyChannel` adds the ownership purpose not
encoded by the raw token: evidence that this boot's controller was admitted and
has never passed through the raw transfer path. It has a private wrapped static
`Channel`, no Clone/Copy, no reborrow, no raw mutable access and no token-release
method. The original `Channel` remains the type-erased low-level handle.

| Event | Admission | Transfer state | Resources visible to application |
|---|---|---|---|
| Before successful HAL startup | Unavailable | Idle | No normal singleton yet |
| Qualified startup | Available | Idle | Physical singleton |
| Safe acquisition | Owned | Idle | CopyChannel |
| Rejected copy configuration | Owned | Idle | Same CopyChannel and both slices |
| Successful launch | Owned | Running | Only OwnedCopy future |
| Clean completion handback | Owned | Idle | Same CopyChannel and both slices |
| Transfer error/ambiguous completion | Owned | Finished/reserved | Only Error; no owner recovery |
| Forget future | Owned | Running or Finished/reserved | No owner recovery |
| Drop future | Owned | Waits; Idle on clean success, reserved on error | Owners discarded, never exposed |
| Raw Channel::new or consuming into_raw | Raw permanently | Existing raw lifecycle | Raw Channel only |

`CopyChannel::into_raw` is a consuming downgrade. A raw `Channel` cannot be
converted back to `CopyChannel`. Raw acquisition marks `Raw` even if performed
using a temporary token reborrow; returning the raw transfer's software phase to
Idle after TE cannot restore admission. Failed admission never turns Available
because the registers subsequently look idle. There is no safe force/retry/reset
or quarantine recovery operation.

The generic owner parameter on `OwnedCopy<W, C>`, `CopyResources<W, C>` and
`CopyConfigError<W, C>` avoids a second engine or repeated wrapper lifecycle.
The default C remains `Channel<'static>` for existing raw callers. The new safe
path uses C=`CopyChannel`. Only private construction creates the future, and
success/configuration-error outputs preserve C exactly. Public resources can be
used after handback, but do not permit constructing a running future or minting
a capability. Both actual owner types are Unpin; the Future implementation has
that ordinary bound without pretending Pin makes forgotten borrows safe.

## Memory, completion, interrupt and cancellation proof

Prelaunch validation preserves the existing rules: equal nonempty lengths up to
65535, aligned 32-bit nonwrapping addresses, entire byte ranges within the exact
selected SRAM extent and disjoint buffers. Static exclusive references express
ownership of both memory regions; no source/destination reference is exposed
while DMA may access them. Every ordinary rejection precedes hardware launch and
returns the same owners. No additional operation after launch can return an
ordinary configuration error and release them.

The common engine uses software BLOCK, REPEAT=1, equal width and both address
increments. State becomes Running before DMA enable/SOFTSRC, under the same
critical section as ISR observation and first-poll waker registration. A SeqCst
fence before enable publishes source data. Wakers are taken under the critical
section and invoked outside it.

The handler first checks that this channel is Running. It does not read or
acknowledge flags for an Idle, unclaimed, rejected or already-finished channel.
That matters when DMACH23/DMACH45 invokes multiple handlers. For owned Running
state it reads its TC/TE only; TE wins over simultaneous TC. The typed R1W0
`ICR::write_noop` seed clears only this channel's observed flags and preserves
all other channels and reserved bits. It disables this channel and interrupts
after terminal indication, fences, and publishes Finished. Disabling EN supplies
no release evidence of its own.

Only recorded TC without TE, CSR.STATUS=Complete (5) and SOFTSRC=0 permit
handback. The manuals define TC as all data correctly transferred. This supplies
the architectural successful-completion evidence; the extra readbacks reject
inconsistency conservatively. Acquire before async Ready, final SeqCst before
resource return, and Transfer Drop's fence preserve CPU/compiler ordering.
Fences do not prove another bus master drained; the documented completion does.

On TE, TC+TE or inconsistent success readback, the future forgets its internal
Transfer and resources. It never invokes the raw Transfer Drop that would reset
state to Idle. The static allocations stay live and reserved even if hardware
might later access them. A forgotten whole future likewise retains its owner,
static buffers and reservation; a late IRQ can record Finished but never frees
it. No safe destructor dependency is used to keep borrowed stack/heap memory
alive.

Drop retains the prior behavior: synchronously service flags until a terminal
completion/error, even with CPU interrupts masked. It does not clear EN first.
On clean completion it discards the recovered static owners; on error it leaks
all owners. Hardware starvation/failure may make Drop wait forever. This is a
memory-safe static-owned subset, not bounded early cancellation. The borrowed
unsafe Transfer contract still requires the caller to retain forgotten borrows
and independently prove error-time quiescence before reuse.

Document/text SHA-256s, exact source URLs and page hashes for x030/L083 are in
`dma-safe-owned-copy-evidence.json`, extending the existing

These are each family's own manuals; shared register layout is not used as a
substitute. Exact part SRAM capacity remains generated from the already-reviewed
datasheets. The original x030/L083 safe layer introduced no metadata, register
schema or PAC adapter. F020 adds only its native ICR command seed through
the existing register-write schema. The native four-channel cohort adds its
own eight-field ICR seed through that same schema; no schema or adapter is added.
Pinned Embassy revision
`f16efeffe37581092ec184718e6fdb1620393214` supplies the Peri/singleton/IRQ/future
idioms; its STM32-specific cancellation sequence is not imported as CW32 proof.

## Compatibility and validation scope

The raw constructor signatures retain their defaults and unsafe obligations.
Existing raw Channel reborrows and borrowed Transfer behavior remain available.
Raw acquisition now permanently revokes future safe admission, and an unowned
shared-vector handler no longer clears stale flags. Low-level integrations must
own/silence inherited interrupt sources before raw Channel acquisition; otherwise
unmasking an IRQ with stale TCIE/TEIE flags can repeatedly interrupt. Ordinary
reset-started applications have no inherited source.

The real F030 and all five exact L083 firmware examples now use safe acquisition
and safe copies, including blocking u16, concurrent u8/u32 shared-vector futures,
comparison and recovered-owner reuse. Their build receipts record exact ARM
commands, code snapshots, exit status and linked ELF hashes outside the source
package. Existing source/data/PAC evidence validators are retained. No HAL test,
mock register bank, synthetic API compile probe, firmware execution, flash,
silicon, throughput or liveness claim is made.

The [F020 firmware](../examples/f020-dma/README.md) has separate owned-copy
and staged-TX binaries for each of the three exact parts. Stage84 main passed
15 actual ARM library builds and 16 ELF links; generation and five finite
source gates passed in documented segments. Independent runtime and
metadata/source reviews accepted the main work. At main acceptance clean
had not run; final-package completion requires a separate final-source
2-library/4-ELF clean receipt. The [verification boundary](f020-dma-owned.md#verification-boundary)
retains warning/failure history and the generated delta. These software
checks do not establish hardware behavior.

The [four-channel firmware](../examples/four-channel-dma/README.md) separately
exercises all four physical channels and u8/u16/u32 copies with clean-owner
reuse, plus the eleven exact package TX selections. Stage85 main passed six
standalone ARM library builds and 21 ELF links, all 27 commands exiting zero
without warnings. Generation, five finite source gates and the capability
renderer passed in documented segments; three source checker preparation
failures remain recorded in [the verification boundary](four-channel-dma-owned.md#verification-boundary).
At main acceptance clean had not run; final-package completion requires a
separate final-source 2-library/4-ELF clean receipt. Source review and compilation
do not establish on-silicon transfer, error-time bus drain, dynamic stack bounds
or finite liveness.

## Native L012 owned DMA

Exactly CW32L012C8T6/C8U6 add owned static-SRAM copies and staged byte UART TX.
Each has 64 KiB Flash and 8 KiB SRAM; generic `cw32l012` retains safe admission
and staging rejection for missing memory metadata. Its native descriptor has
separate programmed CNT and current CCNT, and RESTART/SRCLOAD/DSTLOAD stay
zero. CH1/2 share DMACH12 IRQ9 and CH3/4 share DMACH34 IRQ10; IRQ11 is CORDIC.
UART1/2/3 use PA9/PA7/PA8 AF1 respectively on both packages. Only clean own
TC without TE plus STATUS5 permits request closure and staging reuse; software
copy additionally requires SOFTSRC0. Errors permanently retain resources,
forget leaks and Drop may wait indefinitely. Flush separately waits for TXBUSY0.

Native PAC SIZE/STATUS/TRANS/TYPE fields become typed enums; CCNT register
handles become read-only and CSR TC/TE setters are removed. STATUS stays RW.
Existing callers of these PAC fields must use the corrected types/access.
No DMA RX/combined UART, SPI, other hardware request or early-abort API is added.
Stage86 main passed four standalone ARM libraries and eleven ELF links,
all fifteen commands exiting zero with no warnings. The 1,413 authored files,
910 generated files, toolchain and Cargo configuration stayed unchanged.
Generation and the DMA projection check passed in one successful segment;
the own-source checker, provenance, renderer, consistency and layout checks
passed in a separate five-command tail. Two earlier preparation failures are
preserved: current provenance misread retained historical source identities,
and a CSR prefix also matched CSRCADDR. The precise corrections preserve full
source identity and all five CSR access assertions; no original or hardware
fact was changed. At main acceptance clean had not run; final-package completion
requires a separate final-source two-library/four-ELF clean receipt.
See [the own-L012 contract](l012-dma-owned.md) and [ordinary firmware](../examples/l012-dma/README.md).
