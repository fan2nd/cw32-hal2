# Native LIN receive events

`LinReceiver` exclusively owns L010/L011 UART1 or L012 UART1/2 and a qualified
RX pin. Blocking, nonwaiting and IRQ-driven event reads use a fixed configured
baud and require 8N1. Construction validates before MMIO, resets the UART, selects
LIN and the 10/11-bit break threshold while RX is disabled, then enables RX only.
L012 UART3 remains excluded pending its clock-gate qualification.

`LinRxEvent` reports `Data(u8)` or `Break`. RXBRK requires one RDR read and joint
RXBRK/FE acknowledgment using the W0C no-op seed. A zero RDR with RXBRK permits
its expected FE; overrun, parity and noise still report errors. A nonzero RDR
reports framing error. FE without RXBRK also reports framing error, including
an early FE before the break detector finishes. Other sampled receive flags are
acknowledged; unrelated TX, idle and timer flags are preserved.

Status, RDR and acknowledgment are not atomic. Service gaps can overwrite data,
merge events or lose their order. `Break` is a hardware observation, not proof
of a valid 13-bit sender break or complete frame. On any error, discard partial
frame state and resynchronize. There is no lossless reception guarantee.

The ISR masks one-shot receive/error/break requests and wakes the reader without
reading RDR or clearing events. Cancellation masks requests without draining data.
A forgotten wait holds no caller-buffer pointer; a later read or owner Drop masks
it. Drop uses the ordinary RX lifecycle and disconnects the pin. Reads have no
timeout. No TX sharing, split, ring, DMA, automatic baud detection, frame parser,
response scheduling or external transceiver control is exposed.

`examples/uart-lin/src/bin/receive.rs` uses UART1 PA0 on L010F8P6 and PA3 on
L011K8T6/L012C8T6/L012C8U6, following canonical AF routes. It observes events at
19,200 baud through a board-configured external transceiver and never responds.
Source review only: compilation, tests, cancellation and board waveforms remain
unverified under the local execution restriction.
