# Safe staged UART RX and split full-duplex DMA

F030/A030/L083 expose `UartRx::new_with_dma` and `Uart::new_with_dma`. The existing
`UartRx` owns the receive lease, while the combined constructor prepares the
UART once and builds its existing TX/RX halves. `split` and `split_ref` remain
the concurrent interface. Standalone and combined constructors require static
UART/pin/channel tokens, exact-part qualified SRAM and exclusive static staging
of 1..=65535 bytes per direction. Both combined buffers and UART configuration
are validated before atomic admission of both channel capabilities, then UART
preparation. Rejected inputs are consumed. Normal reset/clean-runtime startup
and permanent exclusion after raw DMA takeover retain the Stage33 contract.

Ordinary `read(&mut [u8]).await` accepts a local caller buffer. DMA only writes
the consumed private SRAM allocation. Its pointer and capacity are retained
without forming references while DMA may write. Clean chunks are synchronously
copied into the caller. There is no borrowed zero-copy receive API.

## Persistent receive ownership

- Idle: no unresolved DMA. A chunk can be armed or CPU reception used.
- InFlight: stores programmed length, highest observed line error and whether
  that error was reported. DMA owns staging and RDR; the CPU reads neither.
- Ready: recorded TC without TE and current Complete status were accepted,
  DMARX closed, RX flags sampled and acknowledged, then DMA fenced and retired.
  Only this state permits staging copies. Partial consumption keeps the tail.
- Quarantined: DMA TE or ambiguous completion permanently retains resources.
  Later TC never restores staging, channel, pin or clock availability.

Before launch, DMARX is off and only RX flags are initialized; preexisting
PE/FE is returned as an error. InFlight is published before DMA EN. The private
`Channel::start_read` uses the common DMA plan/start path, fixed typed RDR source,
incrementing byte destination, REPEAT=1 and generated request metadata. DMA EN
precedes DMARX, matching the own-manual sequence. Unexpected launch failures
conservatively quarantine. No caller-buffer pointer reaches DMA.

A polled read that is cancelled or forgotten leaves its current chunk running.
A later inherent read settles that chunk, retains a clean Ready tail and can
then arm more chunks. Already copied caller prefixes remain; incomplete chunks
never touch caller memory. Empty inherent reads may await old work but do not
consume Ready bytes. They are not abort operations.

## Line errors, completion and reads

Every DMA await registers UART and DMA wakers before final status observations.
Only PE/FE waiter interrupts are armed; RC remains masked. The UART ISR only
masks/wakes, leaving RDR and status intact. A line error returns promptly even
if the peer stops before completing the DMA count. The request remains running,
the invalid chunk is retained, and its error is reported once. A later inherent
read can await the old count and discard it only after clean DMA completion.
If the peer sends no more bytes this recovery can wait indefinitely.

DMA TE/ambiguous completion takes precedence and quarantines. Otherwise parity
precedes framing and both precede accepting data. FE/PE is sampled again after
clean DMA completion and DMARX closure. An invalid clean chunk retires safely
but is discarded; an unreported error is returned. A new error after the final
snapshot remains for the next reception. There are no per-byte error tags.

The SDK confirms that reading RDR does not clear RC. Therefore stale RC after
DMA is acknowledged with the generated R1W0 no-op command and never read as an
extra byte. Selected RX acknowledgments preserve TX/CTS and reserved fields.
No line-error path treats a UART flag, EN=0, cleared DMARX, zero count, TE or a
stop-request status as proof that DMA bus accesses drained.

`blocking_read` first makes one nonblocking selected-channel observation,
servicing flags even with CPU interrupts masked. Pending yields DmaBusy and
fault/quarantine yields an error. After clean completion it copies Ready bytes
and uses CPU RDR reads only after the DMA lease is idle. It starts no new DMA.
The `embedded_io` and `embedded_io_async` Read implementations retain one-byte
short reads. A previously abandoned pending chunk yields DmaBusy rather than
secretly waiting for a longer count. Empty trait reads make at most one such
nonblocking observation and return zero or an ordinary error. They never await
recovery. The accepted immediate empty async Write trait behavior is preserved.

## Split ownership and Drop

UART state tracks live and retained TX/RX ownership separately under a critical
section. Shared CR2 and IER read-modify-writes use that same protocol. An abandoned
TX cannot disable live RX dispatch or erase its DMARX/interrupt updates, and an
abandoned RX cannot disable live TX. Dropping either direction masks only that
direction's waiters. Clean/idle halves disable only their TXEN/CTS or RXEN/RTS
and release pins. Unresolved/quarantined halves forget private DMA/staging/pins
and preserve requests, UART configuration and clocks. RX Drop checks its phase,
not merely whether the last result was a line error: a clean invalid chunk is
safe to discard, an unresolved invalid chunk is still retained.

When neither half is live, the UART dispatch guard becomes inactive. UART clocks
remain on if either direction is retained. No late DMA completion resurrects an
abandoned owner. Only when neither direction is live or retained is the UART
clock gated. L083 keeps its existing shared-vector rule: never disable or unpend
a partner's vector, and skip inactive partners before clock-gated MMIO. The DMA
controller clock and other channels are never reset/gated by this lifecycle.

This is finite explicitly armed reception, not continuous/circular/ring/idle-line
RX. Frames may be overwritten or lost during executor, copy and rearm gaps.
F030/A030/L083 have no overrun indication, so no lossless, throughput, bounded-liveness
or early-abort claim is made. No safe return of consumed static resources
or RTS/CTS DMA is introduced. L083 UART1–6 are independently qualified in
[the own-family source record](l083-peripheral-dma.md), including the shared
UART vectors and all five exact parts.

## Own-source evidence

L083 RX and shared UART interrupt evidence is documented separately in
[L083 staged peripheral DMA](l083-peripheral-dma.md); the following x030
references do not substitute for that own-family qualification.
